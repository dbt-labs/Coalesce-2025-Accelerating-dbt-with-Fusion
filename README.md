### ðŸ¥ª The Jaffle Shop ðŸ¦˜

This is a sandbox project for exploring the basic functionality and latest features of dbt Fusion. 
It's based on a fictional restaurant called the Jaffle Shop that serves [jaffles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_iron).

The source and staging layers have already been built for you.
Intentionally, only the dim_customers in the marts layer has been built for you. This is to enable you to play around with dbt Fusion while developing.
Fact and dimension tables aim to answer potential business questions that may arise.

The facts represent an event (i.e. an order placed, a project created, etc.)
The dimension describes that event (i.e. customer, location, etc.)
Together, facts and dimensions are able to form a well-rounded analysis, i.e. customer placing an order

For those looking for inspiration, imagine that you are building out marts to answer the following questions:
- Which customer has visited the most locations?
- List the most loyal customer per location?
- Has anyone ordered anything?
